### **How to Stop Ubuntu From Collecting Data About Your PC**

If you'd like to prevent Ubuntu from collecting and sending data about your system, follow these steps. These methods cover both disabling the data collection features and removing related packages.

---

### **Step 1: Opt-Out During Installation**
When installing Ubuntu, you’ll be asked whether to send system information to Canonical. Select **No** to opt out of data collection during the setup process.

---

### **Step 2: Disable Data Collection After Installation**
If Ubuntu is already installed, you can disable data collection via the settings interface.

1. Open **Settings** from the application menu.
2. Navigate to **Privacy** > **Diagnostics**.
3. Toggle **Send error reports to Canonical** to **Off**.

### **Step 3: Configure or Remove `ubuntu-report`**
`ubuntu-report` is responsible for submitting anonymized system information.

#### Option 1: Disable Data Submission
1. Open a terminal by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T`.
2. Run the following command to disable system data submission:
   ```bash
   ubuntu-report -f send no
   ```
3. Verify the setting:
   ```bash
   ubuntu-report -f
   ```

#### Option 2: Remove `ubuntu-report`
If you prefer not to keep the package, remove it entirely:
```bash
sudo apt remove ubuntu-report
```

---

### **Step 4: Remove Additional Data Collection Tools**
Disable or remove other telemetry-related services:

1. Remove the following packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove popularity-contest apport whoopsie
   ```

2. Mask the related services to prevent reactivation:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl mask apport.service
   sudo systemctl mask whoopsie.service
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Clear Previously Collected Data**
1. Check and clear data collected by `popularity-contest`:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/log/popularity-contest
   ```

2. Remove crash reports generated by `apport`:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/crash/*
   ```

3. Clear `whoopsie` configurations:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/whoopsie/*
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Verify System Configuration**
After completing the steps, ensure no telemetry services are active:
- Check the status of masked services:
  ```bash
  systemctl status apport.service
  systemctl status whoopsie.service
  ```
- Verify the data submission configuration:
  ```bash
  ubuntu-report -f
  ```
